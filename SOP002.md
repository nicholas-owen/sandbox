## 1. Report structure

When a programming project is completed, it is useful to record some information that will allow us to
- see a summary of how the project wen
- learn what works and what doesn't
- match it with similar projects in the future

This information should be added to the relevant issue in the [opportunities tracker](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/research-software-opportunities).
The details to be recorded will vary from project to project. We do not use a fixed format, but the list below is a reasonable starting point.

For some work, such a report may already be written as part of the project deliverables. In those case, it can be enough to attach that report to the issue tracker and briefly comment on any aspects not covered.
