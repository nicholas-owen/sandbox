## Introduction

For those drowning in information overload, [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) offers a lifeline. This powerful tool transcends a simple note-taking app, functioning as an effective knowledge management system for documents and events.

>[!NOTE]
> - Your thoughts are yours.
> - Obsidian stores notes on your device, so you can access them quickly, even offline. No one else can read them, not even us.
> - Your mind is unique.
> - With thousands of plugins and themes, you can shape Obsidian to fit your way of thinking.
> - Your knowledge should last.
> - Obsidian uses open, non-proprietary files, so you're never locked in, and can preserve your data for the long term.
