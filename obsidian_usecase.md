## Introduction

For those drowning in information overload, [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) offers a lifeline. This powerful tool transcends a simple note-taking app, functioning as an effective knowledge management system for documents and events.

>[!NOTE]

> - Obsidian stores notes on your device, so you can access them quickly, even offline. No one else can read them, not even us.
> - Your mind is unique.
> - With thousands of plugins and themes, you can shape Obsidian to fit your way of thinking.
> - Your knowledge should last.
> - Obsidian uses open, non-proprietary files, so you're never locked in, and can preserve your data for the long term.

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—

```dataview
table without ID
	link(file.link, title) as "Event", 
	date as "Date", 
	URL as "Link" ,
	formatType as "Format"
from "General/calendar" 
FLATTEN dateformat(date(this.file.day), "EEE") AS wDay 
FLATTEN ((x) => { Mon: "M", Tue: "T", Wed: "W", Thu: "R", Fri: "F", Sat: "S" , Sun: "U" }[x])(wDay) AS sDay 
where 
	contains(daysOfWeek, sDay) 
	or 
	file.day = this.file.day 
	and
	file.name !="_Index_of_calendar"
sort startTime ASC
```
````
